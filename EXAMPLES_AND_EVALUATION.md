### Examples and Evaluation

#### Overview

A core strength of the “hdl-simulation-accelerated” project is its structured suite of HDL simulation examples, spanning a spectrum from simple, single-module designs to advanced, multi-file projects with real-world protocols and TT-Metal acceleration. This section details the design, evaluation, and integration status of these examples, illustrating both the technical breadth and the practical impact of the proof-of-concept effort.


#### 1. **Examples Directory Structure**

The `examples/` directory is organized to provide incremental learning and to serve as a robust testbed for toolchain development. Each example includes:

* **Verilog (and, where applicable, C++) source files**
* **Testbenches** for verification
* **Makefiles** for build automation
* **README** documentation and instructions
* **TT-Metal integration scripts** for selected cases

Examples are classified as **single-file** (basic modules) or **multi-file** (complex projects with separate DUT and testbench).

#### 3. **Evaluation by Category**

##### A. **File Structure and Complexity**

* **Single-file examples:** Ideal for basic concepts and rapid iteration. Good for onboarding and early-stage testing.
* **Multi-file examples:** Emulate professional EDA project structure, enabling more realistic verification and stressing the conversion workflow.

##### B. **Simulation and Verification Types**

* **Waveform only:** Quick functional checks, especially in early integration (e.g., minimal\_divider).
* **Waveform + Verification:** Combines simulation output with automated pass/fail checks (e.g., counter overflow, protocol adherence).
* **Full/Comprehensive Verification:** Includes randomized testing, edge case coverage, and standards compliance, providing high confidence in design and toolchain.

##### C. **TT-Metal Integration Status**

* **No Integration:** Pure Verilator CPU-based simulation (majority).
* **Partial Integration:** Led\_blinker and uart\_tx\_basic (prototype stage, ongoing development).
* **Full/Working Integration:** minimal\_divider and arbitrary\_struct\_dataflow (end-to-end pipeline running on TT-Metal hardware).

  * **arbitrary\_struct\_dataflow** also demonstrates custom C++ kernel capabilities, data integrity verification, and pipeline processing—critical for future scalability.

##### D. **Verification Complexity**

* Ranges from basic (timing/edge check) to advanced (protocol compliance, randomized stress testing, multi-stage pipelines).

##### E. **Educational and Research Value**

* Examples progress in complexity, supporting both incremental learning and robust toolchain evaluation.
* Serve as reference cases for future TT-Metal integration, optimization, and benchmarking.

  The structured example suite lowers barriers for new contributors and enables scalable experimentation for researchers and EDA tool developers.


#### 5. **Recommendations for Enhancement**

* **Expand TT-Metal Coverage:**
  Continue converting additional examples, especially multi-file and protocol-oriented designs, to fully leverage AI hardware.
* **Benchmark and Metrics:**
  Add simulation performance measurements, resource usage, and acceleration factors to quantify the benefits.
* **Documentation Cross-Referencing:**
  Further link examples to specific use-cases, TT-Metal features, and practical acceleration scenarios.
* **Verification Standardization:**
  Adopt common verification patterns across all examples for consistency.
