**An open-source research initiative exploring the acceleration of hardware description language (HDL) simulation using **Tenstorrent**â€™s TT-Metal platform. This project bridges the world of traditional digital logic design and modern AI accelerators, providing reproducible tools, working examples, and a clear roadmap for scaling HDL verification into the era of high-performance parallel computing.**
**Covering market context, foundational concepts, project goals, development journey, achievements, evaluations, challenges, and future directions, it serves as a blueprint for innovation in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) at the intersection of AI hardware and digital verification.**
