# HDL Simulation Accelerated

## Leveraging AI Hardware for Next-Generation Verilog Simulation


**An open-source research initiative exploring the acceleration of hardware description language (HDL) simulation using Tenstorrentâ€™s TT-Metal platform. This project bridges the world of traditional digital logic design and modern AI accelerators, providing reproducible tools, working examples, and a clear roadmap for scaling HDL verification into the era of high-performance parallel computing.**
