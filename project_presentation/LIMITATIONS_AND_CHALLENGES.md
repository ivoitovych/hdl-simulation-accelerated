## Limitations and Challenges

### Overview

As with any pioneering research project operating at the intersection of hardware acceleration, electronic design automation (EDA), and open-source development, “hdl-simulation-accelerated” has encountered a range of limitations and challenges. Documenting these issues is essential—not only for transparency, but also for informing future development, guiding community contributions, and managing stakeholder expectations.


### 1. **Technical Limitations**

#### A. **Performance Benchmarking Not Yet Realized**

* **Status:**
  The current proof-of-concept (POC) stage has prioritized functional correctness and integration over performance optimization.
* **Impact:**
  No quantitative benchmarks (e.g., simulation speedup, resource utilization) have been gathered or published, leaving the exact acceleration benefits to be evaluated in future phases.

#### B. **Partial Hardware Integration**

* **Status:**
  Only a subset of the provided HDL examples (notably, “minimal\_divider” and “arbitrary\_struct\_dataflow”) are fully ported and validated on TT-Metal hardware.
* **Impact:**
  Most examples still rely on CPU-based simulation, with partial or prototype TT-Metal support in a few cases (e.g., “led\_blinker”, “uart\_tx\_basic”). Broader coverage will require additional engineering.

#### C. **Limited Support for Complex HDL Constructs**

* **Status:**
  The current conversion tool and runtime adaptations are best suited to relatively simple combinatorial and sequential logic.
* **Impact:**
  More advanced Verilog features, large-scale multi-module designs, and vendor-specific constructs may require significant enhancement to the conversion tool and runtime library.

#### D. **TT-Metal Platform Constraints**

* **Status:**
  TT-Metal hardware and software are primarily designed for AI and tensor workloads—not for cycle-accurate, event-driven HDL simulation.
* **Impact:**
  Achieving high simulation fidelity, supporting full language semantics, and optimizing for timing-accurate results may be constrained by hardware architecture and available APIs.


### 2. **Developmental and Process Challenges**

#### A. **Exploratory Research Nature**

* **Status:**
  The project began with no established playbook, roadmap, or direct precedent in the community.
* **Impact:**
  Required extensive exploration, iterative design, and risk-taking. Progress was sometimes unpredictable and non-linear.

#### B. **Single-Developer Limitation**

* **Status:**
  The initial phases—including environment setup, converter design, example creation, and documentation—were undertaken by a single developer.
* **Impact:**
  Progress was necessarily constrained by available human resources, and cross-validation or parallelization of efforts was limited.

#### C. **Toolchain Versioning and Reproducibility Issues**

* **Status:**
  Variations in toolchain versions (e.g., Verilator, Ubuntu, TT-Metal SDK) initially caused inconsistent builds and simulation results.
* **Impact:**
  Addressed via Dockerization and version pinning, but ongoing maintenance and compatibility testing are required.


### 3. **Community and Ecosystem Considerations**

#### A. **Early Stage, Limited Adoption**

* **Status:**
  As a research-oriented proof-of-concept, the project has not yet achieved significant community adoption or external validation.
* **Impact:**
  Feature requests, bug reports, and third-party contributions remain limited. Broader impact will depend on increased visibility and community engagement.

#### B. **Documentation and Usability**

* **Status:**
  While documentation is extensive, the learning curve for new contributors remains high, especially for those unfamiliar with both HDL and AI hardware development.
* **Impact:**
  Onboarding may require further guides, tutorials, and example walkthroughs.


### 4. **Open Problems and Future Technical Challenges**

* **Performance and Scalability:**
  Quantitative performance benchmarking, scaling to large multi-million gate designs, and demonstrating competitive speedups are key open challenges.
* **Verification and Validation:**
  Expanding verification coverage, standardizing test patterns, and supporting advanced features (assertions, coverage metrics, co-simulation) will enhance robustness.
* **Hardware Abstraction and Compatibility:**
  Improving portability and abstraction layers to support other AI accelerators or heterogeneous hardware platforms is an opportunity for broader impact.


### Conclusion

These limitations and challenges reflect both the complexity and the innovative nature of the “hdl-simulation-accelerated” project. Rather than signifying shortcomings, they represent valuable lessons learned and areas for targeted improvement in subsequent development phases. Acknowledging these constraints transparently enables better planning, realistic expectations, and invites focused community collaboration to overcome them.
