### Achievements to Date

#### Overview

Despite the ambitious scope and inherent uncertainties of this research-oriented project, the “hdl-simulation-accelerated” initiative has accomplished several notable milestones. The following achievements validate both the technical feasibility and the future potential of accelerating HDL simulation on AI hardware platform - Tenstorrent’s TT-Metal. These outcomes provide a solid foundation for further development, benchmarking, and real-world adoption.


#### 1. **Proof-of-Concept Demonstration on Real Hardware**

* **Key Milestone:** Successfully executed Verilog HDL simulations—converted via Verilator—on Tenstorrent TT-Metal hardware.
* **Details:**

  * Ran the “minimal\_divider” example (an all-Verilog ripple divider) as a working proof-of-concept on the accelerator.
  * Confirmed that AI hardware designed for tensor computations can be repurposed for digital logic simulation, opening new possibilities for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows.
* **Impact:** Validates the central hypothesis and demonstrates hardware acceleration beyond conventional CPU-based simulation.


#### 2. **Automated Conversion Tool Development**

* **Key Milestone:** Created `verilator2ttmetal.py`, a Python-based converter that translates Verilator-generated C++ code into TT-Metal compute kernels.
* **Details:**

  * Handles parsing, adaptation, and re-packaging of simulation logic for the TT-Metal environment.
  * Supports incremental enhancement and adaptation to more complex designs.
* **Impact:** Lowers the barrier for hardware acceleration, enabling rapid migration of new HDL projects and encouraging experimentation.


#### 3. **Integration into Tenstorrent’s Official Ecosystem**

* **Key Milestone:** Incorporated the project as a submodule in the official TT-Metal repository.
* **Details:**

  * Ensures compatibility with Tenstorrent’s build systems (CMake, Makefile) and facilitates seamless deployment and testing on Tenstorrent hardware.
* **Impact:** Expands project accessibility, fosters collaboration, and signals recognition by the hardware vendor.


#### 4. **Comprehensive Suite of HDL Simulation Examples**

* **Key Milestone:** Developed and documented a diverse collection of HDL examples, progressing from basic modules to advanced dataflow designs.
* **Details:**

  * Examples include: 8-bit counter, edge detector, LED blinker, minimal divider, serial CRC-32 generator, universal shift register, simple ALU, UART transmitter, split pipeline simulation, and advanced dataflow using custom C++ structures.
  * Each example features Verilog source code, testbenches, Makefiles, and (where applicable) TT-Metal integration scripts.
* **Impact:** Serves as both an educational resource and a robust testbed for future research and toolchain validation.


#### 5. **End-to-End Reproducible Environment**

* **Key Milestone:** Established a Docker-based, fully reproducible development and simulation environment.
* **Details:**

  * Fixed Ubuntu LTS base, pre-configured with Verilator, compilers, TT-Metal SDK, GTKWave, and supporting tools.
  * Ensures simulations and builds are consistent across systems and over time.
* **Impact:** Greatly simplifies onboarding, increases reliability, and enables repeatable research.


#### 6. **Documentation and Planning Infrastructure**

* **Key Milestone:** Produced detailed project documentation and multi-phase planning resources.
* **Details:**

  * Authored documentation to guide users, contributors, and stakeholders.
  * Documentation covers setup, example usage, architectural decisions, and task breakdown (mirroring industry-standard project management approaches).
* **Impact:** Enhances transparency, invites community involvement, and provides a clear vision for ongoing and future development.


#### 7. **Bidirectional Host-to-Kernel Communication Demonstrations**

* **Key Milestone:** Demonstrated and validated communication between simulation host (CPU) and TT-Metal compute kernels.
* **Details:**

  * Developed examples supporting arbitrary data exchange, verification feedback, and pipeline synchronization.
* **Impact:** Proves TT-Metal’s capability for interactive simulation, not just batch processing—an important step for practical EDA workflow integration.


#### 8. **Community-Ready, Open-Source Orientation**

* **Key Milestone:** Project released under an open-source license, welcoming feedback and contributions.
* **Details:**

  * Issues, discussions, and contribution guidelines are in place to support community engagement and collaborative innovation.
* **Impact:** Lays the groundwork for broader adoption, third-party extension, and academic/industry collaboration.
