# Conclusion

The “hdl-simulation-accelerated” project marks a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional hardware description language (HDL) simulation and the rapidly advancing world of AI accelerators. Through a research-driven, open-source approach, the project has demonstrated not just the feasibility, but also the practical path to enabling Verilog-based simulations on massively parallel hardware like Tenstorrent’s TT-Metal platform.

From the initial exploration of toolchains and the creation of a reproducible development environment, to the design of a robust converter tool and the successful execution of proof-of-concept simulations on real hardware, the project has delivered on its short-term goals. The diverse suite of HDL examples, the documented methodology, and the upstream integration with Tenstorrent’s ecosystem collectively validate the core hypothesis: that AI accelerators can be repurposed for advanced EDA workflows, potentially transforming digital design verification.

At the same time, the honest assessment of current limitations and challenges has set a clear, actionable agenda for future development. The roadmap outlined—including expanded TT-Metal coverage, performance benchmarking, advanced verification, and broader ecosystem support—ensures the project remains forward-looking and relevant.

Critically, the project’s open-source orientation and comprehensive documentation make it accessible to researchers, students, and practitioners alike. By lowering barriers to entry and inviting collaboration, “hdl-simulation-accelerated” positions itself as a catalyst for innovation in the emerging field of high-performance, hardware-accelerated simulation.

In summary, while much work remains to fully realize the vision of scalable, production-grade accelerated HDL simulation, the foundation is strong and momentum is building. The project stands ready for community engagement, industrial adoption, and ongoing research, paving the way for a new era in digital verification powered by AI hardware.
