#### 2. **Performance Benchmarking and Optimization**

* **Goal:**
  Move beyond functional correctness to demonstrate concrete performance improvements and resource utilization benefits.
* **Actions:**

  * Design and execute benchmark tests comparing CPU-based and TT-Metal-accelerated simulations (e.g., runtime, throughput, power usage).
  * Profile bottlenecks and optimize kernel code and runtime frameworks.
  * Collect, document, and publish performance data for select examples.
* **Outcome:**
  Provide quantifiable metrics that validate the value of hardware acceleration, supporting technical and business cases for adoption.


#### 3. **Support for Advanced HDL Constructs and Larger Designs**

* **Goal:**
  Enable the simulation of more complex, industry-scale circuits—approaching the needs of real-world ASIC/FPGA verification.
* **Actions:**

  * Extend the conversion toolchain to support advanced Verilog/SystemVerilog features, larger testbenches, and multi-module projects.
  * Explore distributed and parallel simulation models leveraging TT-Metal’s architecture.
  * Pilot simulations with larger, community-contributed or open-source IP blocks.
* **Outcome:**
  Move from educational/toy designs to industry-relevant use cases, broadening project impact.


#### 4. **Verification, Validation, and Testing Enhancements**

* **Goal:**
  Increase the reliability, repeatability, and thoroughness of simulations on TT-Metal.
* **Actions:**

  * Standardize verification patterns across all examples.
  * Add support for assertion-based checking, coverage analysis, and automated regression testing.
  * Implement CI/CD pipelines for reproducible builds and simulations.
* **Outcome:**
  Deliver higher confidence in simulation correctness and facilitate continuous improvement.


#### 5. **Documentation, Usability, and Community Growth**

* **Goal:**
  Lower barriers to entry for new users, researchers, and contributors; foster an open and collaborative ecosystem.
* **Actions:**

  * Expand and improve onboarding documentation, tutorials, and usage guides.
  * Host webinars, write blog posts, and participate in relevant forums to raise project visibility.
  * Encourage contributions via issues, code reviews, and open discussions.
  * Partner with academic and industrial stakeholders for pilot projects or joint research.
* **Outcome:**
  Build a vibrant, sustainable community around accelerated HDL simulation and TT-Metal hardware.


#### 6. **Broaden Hardware and Ecosystem Compatibility**

* **Goal:**
  Make the solution portable and extensible to other AI accelerator platforms and heterogeneous environments.
* **Actions:**

  * Abstract hardware dependencies in the conversion/runtime layers.
  * Establish modular interfaces for integration with third-party EDA tools and cloud environments.
* **Outcome:**
  Enable wider adoption and future-proof the technology against evolving hardware trends.


#### 7. **Prepare for Production-Readiness and Real-World Applications**

* **Goal:**
  Transition from research prototype to practical, scalable solution.
* **Actions:**

  * Engage with early adopters and collect feedback from real-world use.
  * Harden the toolchain, improve error handling, and document limitations clearly.
  * Pilot integration with commercial EDA tool flows or cloud-based verification services.
* **Outcome:**
  Position the project for adoption in professional chip design and verification workflows.


#### Conclusion

By executing on these next stages, “hdl-simulation-accelerated” will mature from a proof-of-concept initiative into a robust, extensible platform for accelerated HDL simulation—unlocking new possibilities for both the EDA and AI hardware communities.
