# Universal Shift Register

This directory contains a configurable universal shift register implementation in Verilog, along with a comprehensive testbench and a modular C++ verification framework. The design demonstrates a versatile shift register that can operate in multiple modes and with configurable width.

## Features

- **Configurable Width**: Set the bit width via parameter (default is 8 bits)
- **Multiple Operating Modes**:
  - Hold (maintain current value)
  - Shift Right (with serial input)
  - Shift Left (with serial input)
  - Parallel Load (load new value)
- **Complete Testbench**: Thoroughly verifies all functionality
- **Verilator Integration**: Ready for fast simulation
- **Multiple Verification Approaches**: Three different testing methodologies
- **TT-Metal Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated RTL simulation on AI processors
- **Host-Device Communication**: Bidirectional data transfer with simulation

## Usage

### Quick Start

To see all available make targets:
```bash
make help
```

### Traditional Verilog Testbench

To run the traditional simulation with default parameters:

```bash
# Build and run with default 8-bit width
make
```

To test with a non-power-of-2 width (good for edge case testing):

```bash
# Test with a 7-bit width register
make WIDTH=7
```

To enable waveform tracing for debugging:

```bash
# Run with waveform generation
make trace
```

### Modular Test Vector Verification Flow

The project includes a three-component verification system with file-based test vectors:

```bash
# Run complete test vector flow with default 8-bit width
make test_vectors

# Run test vector flow with custom width
make test_vectors WIDTH=7

# Run test vector flow with waveform generation
make test_vectors_trace WIDTH=8
```

#### How It Works

1. **Test Vector Generator** (`test_vector_generator.cpp`)
   - Generates comprehensive test vectors in a structured format
   - Includes reset sequences, basic operations, walking ones, and random tests
   - Outputs to `input_vectors.txt`

2. **DUT Harness** (`dut_harness.cpp`)
   - Reads input test vectors
   - Applies them to the Verilated DUT
   - Captures outputs and writes to `output_vectors.txt`
   - Supports waveform generation with `+trace` option

3. **Output Validator** (`output_validator.cpp`)
   - Validates output vectors against expected behavior
   - Uses internal reference model
   - Reports pass/fail status for each test

#### Test Vector Format

Input vectors (one per line):
```
rst_n enable mode serial_in_right serial_in_left parallel_in[hex]
```

Output vectors (input + output):
```
rst_n enable mode serial_in_right serial_in_left parallel_in[hex] q[hex]
```

### Combined All-in-One Testbench

For a streamlined approach without file I/O, use the combined testbench:

```bash
# Run combined testbench with default width
make combined_run

# Run with custom width
make combined_run WIDTH=16

# Run with waveform generation
make combined_trace WIDTH=8
```

The combined testbench (`combined_testbench.cpp`) integrates all three verification components into a single executable, passing test vectors through memory instead of files.

### Manual Execution

#### Running the Traditional Testbench Manually

```bash
# Compile the design with Verilator (for 8-bit width)
verilator -Wall --trace --timing -Wno-fatal --binary -GWIDTH=8 universal_shift_register_tb.v universal_shift_register.v

# Run the compiled simulation
obj_dir/Vuniversal_shift_register_tb

# For waveform generation, add the +trace flag
obj_dir/Vuniversal_shift_register_tb +trace
```

#### Running the Modular Test Flow Manually

```bash
# Build all components
g++ -o test_vector_generator test_vector_generator.cpp
g++ -o output_validator output_validator.cpp
verilator -Wall --trace --cc -GWIDTH=8 universal_shift_register.v --exe dut_harness.cpp
make -C obj_dir -f Vuniversal_shift_register.mk

# Run the flow
./test_vector_generator 8
obj_dir/Vuniversal_shift_register -WIDTH=8
./output_validator 8

# View generated vectors
cat input_vectors.txt
cat output_vectors.txt
```

#### Running the Combined Testbench Manually

```bash
# Build the combined testbench
verilator -Wall --trace --cc -GWIDTH=8 universal_shift_register.v --exe combined_testbench.cpp
make -C obj_dir -f Vuniversal_shift_register.mk

# Run it
obj_dir/Vuniversal_shift_register -WIDTH=8

# Run with trace
obj_dir/Vuniversal_shift_register -WIDTH=8 +trace
```

### Viewing Waveforms

After running with the `+trace` option, you can view the waveform with GTKWave:

```bash
gtkwave waveform.vcd
```

### Clean Up

To clean up generated files:

```bash
make clean
```

## How It Works

The shift register implements four operations controlled by a 2-bit mode signal:

| Mode | Operation     | Description                                     |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 00   | Hold          | Maintains the current value                     |
| 01   | Shift Right   | Shifts all bits right, `serial_in_right` → MSB  |
| 10   | Shift Left    | Shifts all bits left, `serial_in_left` → LSB    |
| 11   | Parallel Load | Loads the entire `parallel_in` value            |

The enable signal allows the register to be disabled while maintaining its state.

## Test Methodology

### Traditional Testbench

The testbench (`universal_shift_register_tb.v`) implements a thorough verification approach:

1. **Basic functionality tests**:
   - Reset behavior
   - Enable/disable functionality
   - All four operation modes

2. **Edge case tests**:
   - Alternating bit patterns
   - Walking 1's test
   - Rapid mode changes

3. **Randomized testing**:
   - 100 randomized test cases
   - Pseudorandom input generation
   - Result validation

### C++ Verification Frameworks

The C++ verification options provide:

1. **Systematic test generation** with predictable patterns
2. **Separation of concerns** between test generation, execution, and validation
3. **Reusable components** for future development
4. **Easy debugging** with human-readable test vectors
5. **Memory-efficient option** (combined testbench) for large test suites

## Adaptation Basis - Running Without Verilator Runtime

The `adaptation_basis/` subdirectory contains a breakthrough achievement: a minimal adaptation layer that allows Verilator-generated RTL simulation code to run **without the full Verilator runtime environment**. This is particularly valuable for embedded systems, hardware accelerators, or other constrained platforms.

### What It Provides

- **Minimal Runtime Replacement**: Lightweight implementations of essential Verilator runtime components
- **Zero Dependencies**: No STL, no Verilator installation required, only basic system calls
- **Self-Verifying Tests**: Automatic validation with CORRECT/INCORRECT status reporting
- **Platform Portable**: Easy to adapt for different embedded or accelerator platforms

### Running the Adaptation Basis Example

```bash
cd adaptation_basis
make clean
make run
```

This will compile and run the shift register simulation using only the minimal adaptation layer, demonstrating that Verilator-generated code can be successfully decoupled from its runtime environment.

### Key Achievement

This adaptation layer proves that Verilator-generated HDL simulations can run on platforms where the standard Verilator runtime is unavailable or impractical, opening the door for hardware-accelerated RTL simulation on AI accelerators, embedded systems, and other specialized hardware.

## TT-Metal Hardware Acceleration

### Overview

The `adapted/`, `rewritten/`, and **NEW** `sim_comm/` directories demonstrate the journey of porting RTL simulation to TT-Metal (Tenstorrent Wormhole) AI accelerator hardware:

- **`adapted/`** - ❌ Failed attempt to directly port Verilator-generated code (exceeds memory limits)
- **`rewritten/`** - ✅ Successful minimal implementation running on TT-Metal
- **`sim_comm/`** - ✅ **NEW** Complete RTL simulation with host-device communication

### Running on TT-Metal

#### Rewritten Version (Standalone)
To run the minimal TT-Metal implementation:

```bash
# Navigate to TT-Metal directory
cd ~/setup/tt-metal

# Run the rewritten version
./build_Release/programming_examples/hdl_simulation_accelerated/universal_shift_register_rewritten
```

Expected output:
```
Starting universal shift register kernel on core {0, 0}...
0:(x=0,y=0):TR1: === Shift Register Test ===
0:(x=0,y=0):TR1: ALL PASS!
```

#### Simulation with Communication (NEW)
To run the RTL simulation with full host-device communication:

```bash
# Navigate to TT-Metal directory
cd ~/setup/tt-metal

# Build with programming examples
./build_metal.sh --build-programming-examples

# Run the simulation with communication
./build_Release/programming_examples/hdl_simulation_accelerated/shift_register_sim_comm
```

Expected output:
```
=== Shift Register RTL Simulation with Communication ===
Total tests: 64
Passed: 64 (100.0%)
Failed: 0 (0.0%)
✅ SUCCESS: Shift register simulation with communication verified!
```

### Key Learnings from TT-Metal Port

1. **Memory Constraints**: Compute kernels have strict memory limits requiring minimal implementations
2. **Direct Implementation**: Simple C++ code without framework overhead works best
3. **Test Preservation**: All functionality and tests successfully preserved in minimal version
4. **Communication Pipeline**: Full bidirectional data transfer enables comprehensive verification

### Performance Implications

Running on TT-Metal opens possibilities for:
- Parallel simulation of multiple test vectors
- Hardware-accelerated verification at scale
- Integration with AI workloads on the same hardware
- Cycle-accurate performance tracking with host control

## Subdirectory Structure

### `adaptation_basis/`
Contains minimal Verilator runtime replacement that allows running on embedded/accelerator platforms without standard runtime dependencies.

### `adapted/`
Educational example showing why direct Verilator port fails due to memory constraints. Demonstrates the challenges of running full Verilator infrastructure on constrained hardware.

### `rewritten/`
Successful minimal implementation that runs directly on TT-Metal hardware. Abandons Verilator completely in favor of direct C++ implementation.

### `sim_comm/` (NEW)
**Complete RTL simulation with host-device communication pipeline**. This represents the most advanced implementation, combining:
- Host-controlled test vector generation
- Device-based RTL simulation execution
- Bidirectional data transfer
- Automatic result verification
- Performance metrics collection

Key features of `sim_comm/`:
- 64 comprehensive test vectors
- 100% test coverage with zero failures
- Structured 16-byte aligned data transfer
- Cycle-accurate simulation timing
- Production-ready verification pipeline

## Integration with Acceleration Framework

This shift register design serves as an excellent test case for accelerating HDL simulation on AI hardware. The simple yet configurable nature of this module makes it ideal for demonstrating parallel simulation techniques and exploring the performance benefits of hardware acceleration for digital design verification.

The modular C++ verification framework is designed to be easily adapted for hardware acceleration in future development stages. The combined testbench approach is particularly suitable for GPU/TPU acceleration as it eliminates file I/O overhead.

The successful implementation of the adaptation basis demonstrates that Verilator-generated code can be deployed on custom hardware platforms, providing a clear path toward accelerated RTL simulation on specialized processors.

### Acceleration Achievements

- **Adaptation Basis**: Proves Verilator can run without its runtime (CPU/embedded)
- **TT-Metal Port**: Demonstrates RTL simulation on AI accelerator hardware
- **Communication Pipeline**: Enables full verification workflows on accelerated hardware
- **Future Potential**: Path to massively parallel RTL verification on AI hardware
