### **Phase 0: Proof of Concept (PoC) â€“ Single Core Execution**

**Goal:** Validate that the accelerator can run basic HDL simulation workloads.

* Select a minimal, simple HDL simulation example (e.g., a basic ALU or counter circuit).
* Port and execute the example on **one core** of the AI accelerator.
* Establish baseline compute behavior, memory access, and execution performance.

**Success Criteria:**

* Functional execution of an HDL simulation kernel on a single accelerator core.

### **Phase 1: Multi-Core and Intra-Chip Communication**

**Goal:** Demonstrate parallel simulation capability within a single accelerator chip.

* Expand execution from single core to **multi-core simulation**.
* Develop mechanisms for **synchronization between cores**.
* Design and implement an **inter-core communication protocol**.
* Optimize for simulation granularity: minimize communication overhead vs. maximize computation per core.

**Success Criteria:**

* Run a moderately complex design (e.g., simple CPU) partitioned over multiple cores with correct simulation results.

### **Phase 2: Large-Scale Partitioned Simulation**

**Goal:** Simulate a complex hardware design similar to real-world workloads.

* Implement **design partitioning strategies** to map simulation blocks to cores.
* Address **core synchronization overhead** and latency minimization.
* Establish **scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms** for cores.
* Validate simulation with large designs such as a full RISC-V or ARM-like CPU core.

**Success Criteria:**

* Efficient simulation of a high-complexity design with measurable performance gains over CPU/GPU approaches.

### **Phase 3: Production-Level Real-World Simulation**

**Goal:** Support practical, high-performance simulation of full-scale hardware systems.

* Generalize simulation framework to handle industrial-level designs (e.g., SoC or FPGA-level simulations).
* Provide APIs or tooling for users to map HDL designs to accelerator resources.
* Fine-tune communication protocols for maximum scalability and performance.
* Add checkpointing and debugging support.

**Success Criteria:**

* Run real-world hardware designs with production-level reliability and repeatability.

### **Phase 4: Cluster-Scale Distributed Simulation**

**Goal:** Scale simulation across multiple AI accelerator chips or nodes.

* Develop **inter-chip communication protocols** (likely over network fabrics like InfiniBand, Ethernet, proprietary links).
* Implement **global synchronization and scheduling** across chips.
* Solve **data partitioning** across chips to balance computation and communication.
* Ensure **fault-tolerance and recovery mechanisms** in cluster simulation.

**Success Criteria:**

* Successfully simulate massive-scale designs across multiple accelerator nodes with efficient resource utilization.

### **(Optional) Phase 5: Ecosystem and Usability**

**Goal:** Make the system production-ready for customers or internal teams.

* Provide integration with standard HDL simulation languages and tools (e.g., Verilog, VHDL frontends).
* Develop SDK/documentation for users to run their designs.
* Benchmark and publish results vs. existing CPU/GPU simulation frameworks.
